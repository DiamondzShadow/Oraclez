## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NEXT STEPS

### **These credentials MUST be rotated immediately:**

### 1. Google/YouTube API Key (URGENT)
```
Current (COMPROMISED): AIzaSyAnFc7iHqA-Fcqx_PI043WdZumQYtYbPdI
Action Required: Regenerate at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
```

**Steps:**
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Select project: StreamTz (id: streamtz)
3. Regenerate or delete the exposed API key
4. Create a new API key with proper restrictions
5. Update `.env` file with new key
6. Add API restrictions (IP allowlist, API restrictions to YouTube Data API v3 only)

### 2. Supabase Credentials (URGENT)
```
Action Required: Reset JWT secret at https://app.supabase.com/
```

**Steps:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Settings > API
3. Reset JWT Secret (regenerates all tokens)
4. Copy new `anon` and `service_role` keys
5. Update `.env` file with new keys
6. Update any deployed instances

### 3. Database Password (URGENT)
```
Current (COMPROMISED): Vzm7KTmunj2W53D6
Action Required: Change in Supabase Dashboard > Settings > Database
```

### 4. Review Access Logs
- Check Google Cloud Console for unusual API usage
- Review Supabase logs for unauthorized access
- Monitor billing for unexpected charges

## üìä Impact Assessment

### Exposure Window
- **First exposed**: Unknown (commit 270cf857ddec212f1688893e15b4082018711988)
- **Discovery date**: 2025-10-23
- **Remediation date**: 2025-10-23
- **Exposure duration**: Unknown

### Potential Risk
- ‚òëÔ∏è **HIGH**: Credentials were publicly accessible on GitHub
- ‚òëÔ∏è **HIGH**: Full database access via service_role token
- ‚òëÔ∏è **MEDIUM**: YouTube API quota could be consumed
- ‚òëÔ∏è **MEDIUM**: Database could be accessed/modified

## üîê Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Documentation Updates
All documentation now uses placeholder values:
- ‚úÖ `your_youtube_api_key_here` instead of actual keys
- ‚úÖ `https://your-project.supabase.co` instead of specific URLs
- ‚úÖ `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` instead of JWT tokens
- ‚úÖ Instructions to get credentials from dashboards

### 2. Security Documentation
Created comprehensive security documentation:
- ‚úÖ `SECURITY_NOTICE.md` - Detailed incident report and remediation steps
- ‚úÖ `REMEDIATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document
- ‚úÖ Enhanced `.env.example` with security comments

### 3. Code Verification
- ‚úÖ Verified `server.js` uses `process.env` for all credentials
- ‚úÖ Confirmed no hardcoded secrets in application code
- ‚úÖ Verified `.env` is in `.gitignore`
