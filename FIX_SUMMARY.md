# 🔧 Fix Summary - Empty Supabase Tables

## Problem Identified ✅

Your Supabase tables are empty because the `adapter_state` table **hasn't been created yet**. 

I attempted to create the table automatically, but couldn't connect to your database directly due to network restrictions in this environment.

## Solution 📝

You need to run the SQL setup script manually in your Supabase dashboard. Don't worry - it's super simple!

## What You Need To Do (5 minutes) ⚡

### Step 1: Run the SQL Script

1. **Open this link**: https://app.supabase.com/project/wnclwwvnyxmtkcukjrlc/sql/new
2. **Open the file** `supabase-setup.sql` in this project
3. **Copy ALL the contents** (Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+C)
4. **Paste into the Supabase SQL Editor**
5. **Click "Run"** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

That's it! Your table will be created with all the necessary columns, indexes, and security policies.

### Step 2: Configure Your Environment

Run the quick setup script:
```bash
./quick-setup.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env and add your YouTube API key
```

Your `.env.example` already has the correct Supabase URL and service key filled in!

### Step 3: Test It

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then test with:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "test-123",
    "data": {
      "videoId": "dQw4w9WgXcQ",
      "endpoint": "views"
    }
  }'
```

### Step 4: Verify

Check your Supabase table editor:
https://app.supabase.com/project/wnclwwvnyxmtkcukjrlc/editor

You should see your `adapter_state` table with data!

## Still Having Issues? 🆘

If you get an error after running the SQL script:

1. **Check the error message** in the SQL editor
2. **Make sure you copied the entire script** from `supabase-setup.sql`
3. **Verify you're in the correct project**: wnclwwvnyxmtkcukjrlc
4. **Check your environment variables** in `.env`

## Next Steps After Setup ✨

Once your tables are created and configured:

1. Get your YouTube API key from Google Cloud Console
2. Add it to your `.env` file
3. Start tracking YouTube video stats!
4. Integrate with your Chainlink node
