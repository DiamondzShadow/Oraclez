# 🔧 Setup Status & Next Steps

## ✅ What I Fixed

1. **Git Conflict Resolved**: Removed conflicting `update-server.sh` file and restored from git
2. **Dependencies Installed**: All npm packages installed successfully (763 packages)
3. **Scripts Fixed**: Updated package.json to use `node_modules/.bin/hardhat` for better compatibility
4. **Environment Setup**: Created `.env` file from template
5. **Hardhat Config Fixed**: Updated to handle missing/invalid private keys gracefully

## ⚠️ Current Issue

The `npm run oracle:status` script now runs successfully, BUT it shows an error:

```
❌ Error reading contract: call revert exception
```

**Root Cause**: The contract at address `0xD66544E49c7407AcdE0a577BFB176f950a18DAAA` **does not exist** on Arbitrum Sepolia.

I verified this by checking the blockchain directly - the address has no contract code deployed.

## 🎯 What You Need To Do Next

You have **two options**:

### Option 1: Deploy a New Contract (Recommended)

Deploy the `YouTubeOracleFunctions` contract to Arbitrum Sepolia:

1. **Add your private key to `.env`**:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env file
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_64_character_private_key_without_0x_prefix
   ```

2. **Deploy the contract**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   
3. **Update all references** to the new contract address in:
   - `scripts/check-status.js` (line 6)
   - `scripts/set-source-code.js`
   - `scripts/request-views.js`
   - `scripts/monitor-events.js`
   - `scripts/add-consumer-functions.js`
   - `package.json` (line 17)
   - `.env` file

### Option 2: Use an Existing Contract

If the contract is already deployed at a **different address**:

1. **Find the correct address** (check your deployment history, Arbiscan, or wallet)

2. **Update the address** in the same files listed above

## 📋 Required Configuration

Before deploying or using the oracle, you need:

### Essential:
- ✅ **Arbitrum Sepolia RPC**: Already configured (using public RPC)
- ⚠️ **Private Key**: Add to `.env` file (needed for write operations)
- ⚠️ **YouTube API Key**: Add to Chainlink Functions subscription secrets
- ⚠️ **Chainlink Functions Subscription**: You'll need subscription ID 532 or create a new one

### For Contract Deployment:
- Get Arbitrum Sepolia ETH from: https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia
- Get YouTube API key from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

## 🚀 Complete Setup Flow (After You Have Contract Address)

```bash
# 1. Add contract to Chainlink Functions subscription
npm run oracle:add-consumer

# 2. Upload JavaScript source code to contract
npm run oracle:setup

# 3. Check everything is configured
npm run oracle:status

# 4. Request YouTube data
npm run oracle:request

# 5. Monitor events (in separate terminal)
npm run oracle:monitor
```

## 📊 Current Environment

```
✅ Node packages: Installed (763 packages)
✅ Hardhat: Configured and working
✅ Scripts: All scripts ready to use
✅ Network: Arbitrum Sepolia RPC connected
⚠️ Contract: Not deployed at documented address
⚠️ Private Key: Not configured (needed for deployment/transactions)
⚠️ YouTube API: Not configured
```

## 🧪 Test Commands (Read-Only, No Private Key Needed)

These commands work without a private key:

```bash
# Check if contract exists (currently fails - no contract)
npm run oracle:status

# Compile contracts
npm run compile
```

## 📝 Files I Created/Modified

1. **Created**: `.env` - Environment configuration file
2. **Modified**: `hardhat.config.js` - Fixed to handle missing private keys
3. **Modified**: `package.json` - Updated scripts to use local hardhat
4. **Created**: `SETUP_STATUS.md` - This file

## 💡 Quick Deployment Script

If you want to deploy now, here's what to do:

```bash
# 1. Edit .env and add your private key
nano .env  # or use any editor

# 2. Make sure you have Arbitrum Sepolia ETH
# Get from: https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia

# 3. Check if deploy script exists
ls scripts/deploy-functions.js

# 4. Deploy
npm run deploy

# 5. Save the contract address and update all scripts
```
