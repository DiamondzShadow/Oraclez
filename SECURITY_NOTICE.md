---

## üö® REQUIRED ACTIONS - DO THIS NOW

### 1. Rotate Your Google/YouTube API Key (CRITICAL)

**The exposed API key MUST be regenerated immediately.**

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Select project: **StreamTz** (id: streamtz)
3. Find the API key: `AIzaSyAnFc7iHqA-Fcqx_PI043WdZumQYtYbPdI`
4. Click **"Regenerate Key"** or delete and create a new one
5. Add API key restrictions:
   - **Application restrictions**: HTTP referrers or IP addresses
   - **API restrictions**: Restrict to YouTube Data API v3 only
6. Update your local `.env` file with the new key
7. Update any deployed instances with the new key

**Documentation**: [Handling Compromised GCP Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys#securing_an_api_key)

### 2. Rotate Your Supabase Credentials (CRITICAL)

**Both service_role and anon keys were exposed.**

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/project/wnclwwvnyxmtkcukjrlc/settings/api)
2. Navigate to: **Settings** > **API**
3. Click **"Reset JWT Secret"** (this will regenerate all keys)
4. Copy the new `anon` key and `service_role` key
5. Update your local `.env` file with the new keys
6. Update any deployed instances with the new keys

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Resetting JWT secrets will invalidate all existing sessions and tokens.

### 3. Change Your Database Password

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/project/wnclwwvnyxmtkcukjrlc/settings/database)
2. Navigate to: **Settings** > **Database**
3. Change the database password
4. Update connection strings in all applications

### 4. Review API Usage

Check for any unauthorized usage:

**Google Cloud Console:**
1. Go to [APIs & Services > Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard)
2. Check YouTube Data API v3 usage for unusual activity
3. Review billing for unexpected charges

**Supabase:**
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard > **Database** > **Logs**
2. Review authentication logs for suspicious activity
3. Check API usage statistics

### 5. Add API Key Restrictions (IMPORTANT)

After regenerating your keys, add proper restrictions:

**YouTube API Key:**
- Set application restrictions (IP addresses for server-side use)
- Restrict to YouTube Data API v3 only
- Set quota limits if applicable

**Supabase:**
- Review Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Ensure service_role key is only used server-side
- Use anon key with proper RLS for client-side access

## üîí Security Best Practices Going Forward

### 1. Never Commit Secrets

‚úÖ **GOOD** - Use environment variables:
```env
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_key_here
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key_here
```

‚ùå **BAD** - Hardcoding in documentation:
```markdown
API Key: AIzaSyAnFc7iHqA-Fcqx_PI043WdZumQYtYbPdI
```

### 2. Use `.gitignore`

Ensure `.env` is in your `.gitignore`:
```gitignore
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local
```

### 3. Use Placeholders in Documentation

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
```
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key_here
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
```

‚ùå **BAD**:
```
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=AIzaSyAnFc7iHqA-Fcqx_PI043WdZumQYtYbPdI
SUPABASE_URL=https://wnclwwvnyxmtkcukjrlc.supabase.co
```

### 4. Regular Key Rotation

- Rotate API keys every 90 days
- Use different keys for development, staging, and production
- Monitor API usage regularly

### 5. Use Secret Management Services

Consider using:
- Google Cloud Secret Manager
- AWS Secrets Manager
- HashiCorp Vault
- GitHub Secrets (for CI/CD)
